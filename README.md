# Meme Generator React Lessons application from Scrimba

I learned how to create this react web application from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/courses).
I learned how to use api's to fetch memes from an outsourced api.

# About
I learned how to use the fetch and await and sync javascript functions in order to create a request to the url.
I used the map method in order to map over an array of objects to provide the ability to search for the next meme.
I enjoyed learning about creating forms and form validation in order to make a proper request while the user is putting in text. 

#Updates
Since this project I have learned to create more with react and I am using bootstrap in order to provide a simple style and update the code in the package.json to deploy it to my github-pages correctly. 

I added functionality to the form to show how to provide form valiadation.
I added a context provider to show how to use react context provider hook. 
The code has recently been updated using sass and react-bootstrap.
